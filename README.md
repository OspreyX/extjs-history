extjs-history
=============

This project Ext JS wrapper for (https://github.com/browserstate/history.js) which provides a cross 
browser implementation of the [HTML5 History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history). 

## Exposed API

### Functions

####History.init()
Initialize the History class. Must be called before use. Can be called more than once.<br/>
Example:<br/>
`xui.History.init();`<br/>
`var state = xui.History.getState();`

####History.pushState(data, title, url)
Adds a new History entry
- `data` (Object) The data associated with this entry. Accessible as event.data on statechange event object.
- `title` (String) The title for this entry
- `url`  (String) REQUIRED for IE8 to work - The History class will attempt to fix the URL to be compatible with the document URL. For IE8 and HTML5 browsers to play well together, this format works well: '?report=/shipping/overview'

Example:<br/>
`xui.History.pushState({name: 'Jack', ninja: true}, 'Jack Slocum', '?user=1234');`

####History.replaceState(data, title, url)
Replace the current history state
- `data` (Object) The data associated with this entry. Accessible as event.data on statechange event object.
- `title` (String) The title for this entry
- `url`  (String) REQUIRED for IE8 to work - The History class will attempt to fix the URL to be compatible with the document URL. For IE8 and HTML5 browsers to play well together, this format works well: '?report=/shipping/overview'

- `data` (Object) The data associated with this entry.
