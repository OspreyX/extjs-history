extjs-history
=============

This project Ext JS wrapper for (https://github.com/browserstate/history.js), which provides:

- Follow the [HTML5 History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history) as much as possible
- Provide a cross-compatible experience for all HTML5 Browsers (they all implement the HTML5 History API a little bit differently causing different behaviours and sometimes bugs - History.js fixes this ensuring the experience is as expected / the same / great throughout the HTML5 browsers)
- Provide a backwards-compatible experience for all HTML4 Browsers using a hash-fallback (including continued support for the HTML5 History API's `data`, `title`, `pushState` and `replaceState`) with the option to [remove HTML4 support if it is not right for your application](https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/wiki/Intelligent-State-Handling)
- Provide a forwards-compatible experience for HTML4 States to HTML5 States (so if a hash-fallbacked url is accessed by a HTML5 browser it is naturally transformed into its non-hashed url equivalent)
- Provide support for as many javascript frameworks as possible via adapters; especially [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [MooTools](http://mootools.net/), [Prototype](http://www.prototypejs.org/) and [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com/)

## Exposed API

### Functions

- `History.pushState(data,title,url)` <br/> Pushes a new state to the browser; `data` can be null or an object, `title` can be null or a string, `url` must be a string
- `History.replaceState(data,title,url)` <br/> Replaces the existing state with a new state to the browser; `data` can be null or an object, `title` can be null or a string, `url` must be a string
- `History.getState()` <br/> Gets the current state of the browser, returns an object with `data`, `title` and `url`
- `History.getHash()` <br/> Gets the current hash of the browser
- `History.Adapter.bind(element,event,callback)` <br/> A framework independent event binder, you may either use this or your framework's native event binder.
- `History.Adapter.trigger(element,event)` <br/> A framework independent event trigger, you may either use this or your framework's native event trigger.
- `History.Adapter.onDomLoad(callback)` <br/> A framework independent onDomLoad binder, you may either use this or your framework's native onDomLoad binder.
- `History.back()` <br/> Go back once through the history (same as hitting the browser's back button)
- `History.forward()` <br/> Go forward once through the history (same as hitting the browser's forward button)
- `History.go(X)` <br/> If X is negative go back through history X times, if X is positive go forwards through history X times
- `History.log(...)` <br/> Logs messages to the console, the log element, and fallbacks to alert if neither of those two exist
- `History.debug(...)` <br/> Same as `History.log` but only runs if `History.debug.enable === true`

### Events

- `window.onstatechange` <br/> Fired when the state of the page changes (does not include hash changes)
- `window.onanchorchange` <br/> Fired when the anchor of the page changes (does not include state hashes)


## Notes on Compatibility

- History.js **solves** the following browser bugs:
	- HTML5 Browsers
		- Chrome 8 sometimes does not contain the correct state data when traversing back to the initial state
		- Safari 5, Safari iOS 4 and Firefox 3 and 4 do not fire the `onhashchange` event when the page is loaded with a hash
		- Safari 5 and Safari iOS 4 do not fire the `onpopstate` event when the hash has changed unlike the other browsers
		- Safari 5 and Safari iOS 4 fail to return to the correct state once a hash is replaced by a `replaceState` call / [bug report](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=56249)
		- Safari 5 and Safari iOS 4 sometimes fail to apply the state change under busy conditions / [bug report](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=42940)
		- Google Chrome 8,9,10 and Firefox 4 prior to the RC will always fire `onpopstate` once the page has loaded / [change recommendation](http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/03/history-api-changes-in-firefox-4/)
		- Safari iOS 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 have a working HTML5 History API - although the actual back buttons of the browsers do not work, therefore we treat them as HTML4 browsers
		- None of the HTML5 browsers actually utilise the `title` argument to the `pushState` and `replaceState` calls
	- HTML4 Browsers
		- Old browsers like MSIE 6,7 and Firefox 2 do not have a `onhashchange` event
		- MSIE 6 and 7 sometimes do not apply a hash even it was told to (requiring a second call to the apply function)
		- Non-Opera HTML4 browsers sometimes do not apply the hash when the hash is not `urlencoded`
	- All Browsers
		- State data and titles do not persist once the site is left and then returned (includes page refreshes)
		- State titles are never applied to the `document.title`
- ReplaceState functionality is emulated in HTML4 browsers by discarding the replaced state, so when the discarded state is accessed it is skipped using the appropriate `History.back()` / `History.forward()` call
- Data persistance and synchronisation works like so: Every second or so, the SUIDs and URLs of the states will synchronise between the store and the local session. When a new session opens a familiar state (via the SUID or the URL) and it is not found locally then it will attempt to load the last known stored state with that information.
- URLs will be unescaped to the maximum, so for instance the URL `?key=a%20b%252c` will become `?key=a b c`. This is to ensure consistency between browser url encodings.
- Changing the hash of the page causes `onpopstate` to fire (this is expected/standard functionality). To ensure correct compatibility between HTML5 and HTML4 browsers the following events have been created:
	- `window.onstatechange`: this is the same as the `onpopstate` event except it does not fire for traditional anchors
	- `window.onanchorchange`: this is the same as the `onhashchange` event except it does not fire for states
- Known Issues
	- Opera 11 fails to create history entries when under stressful loads (events fire perfectly, just the history events fail) - there is nothing we can do about this
	- Mercury iOS fails to apply url changes (hashes and HTML5 History API states) - there is nothing we can do about this
