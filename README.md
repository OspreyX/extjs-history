extjs-history
=============

This project Ext JS wrapper for (https://github.com/browserstate/history.js):

- Follow the [HTML5 History API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history) as much as possible
- Provide a cross-compatible experience for all HTML5 Browsers (they all implement the HTML5 History API a little bit differently causing different behaviours and sometimes bugs - History.js fixes this ensuring the experience is as expected / the same / great throughout the HTML5 browsers)
- Provide a backwards-compatible experience for all HTML4 Browsers using a hash-fallback (including continued support for the HTML5 History API's `data`, `title`, `pushState` and `replaceState`) with the option to [remove HTML4 support if it is not right for your application](https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/wiki/Intelligent-State-Handling)
- Provide a forwards-compatible experience for HTML4 States to HTML5 States (so if a hash-fallbacked url is accessed by a HTML5 browser it is naturally transformed into its non-hashed url equivalent)

### Functions

####History.pushState(data, title, url)
Adds a new History entry
- `data` (Object) The data associated with this entry. Accessible as event.data on statechange event object.
- `title` (String) The title for this entry
- `url`  (String) REQUIRED for IE8 to work - The History class will attempt to fix the URL to be compatible with the document URL. For IE8 and HTML5 browsers to play well together, this format works well: '?report=/shipping/overview'

Example:
`xui.History.pushState({name: 'Jack', ninja: true}, 'Jack Slocum', '?user=1234');`

####History.replaceState(data, title, url)
Replace the current history state
